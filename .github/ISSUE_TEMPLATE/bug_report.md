<!--
Before filing this issue:
* Make sure you use the latest version with `- uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1` (see https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/blob/master/README.md#versioning)
* If the issue happens on JRuby or TruffleRuby, and does not happen on CRuby (please check), file an issue there instead. It's very unlikely ruby/setup-ruby is the cause.
* Try to reproduce the issue locally by following the workflow steps (including all commands done by ruby/setup-ruby, except for `Downloading Ruby` & `Extracting Ruby`). If it does reproduce locally, it's not a ruby/setup-ruby issue.

Please provide:
* the code of or a link to the workflow used
* the link to the log of a failed workflow job
* the command and output of the step failing
* whether you are using a self-hosted runner
