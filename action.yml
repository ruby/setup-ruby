inputs:
  ruby-version:
    description: 'Engine and version to use, see the syntax in the README. Reads from .ruby-version or .tool-versions if unset.'
    default: 'default'
  rubygems:
    description: |
      The version of RubyGems to use. Either 'default' (the default), 'latest', or a version number (e.g., 3.3.5).
      For 'default', no action is taken and the version of RubyGems that comes with Ruby by default is used.
      For 'latest', `gem update --system` is run to update to the latest RubyGems version.
      Similarly, if a version number is given, `gem update --system <version>` is run to update to that version of RubyGems, as long as that version is newer than the one provided by default.
  bundler:
    description: |
      The version of Bundler to install. Either 'none', 'latest', 'Gemfile.lock', or a version number (e.g., 1, 2, 2.1, 2.1.4).
      For 'Gemfile.lock', the version is determined based on the BUNDLED WITH section from the file Gemfile.lock, $BUNDLE_GEMFILE.lock or gems.locked.
      Defaults to 'default', which means 'Gemfile.lock' if the file exists and 'latest' otherwise.
  bundler-cache:
    description: 'Run "bundle install", and cache the result automatically. Either true or false.'
    default: 'false'
  working-directory:
    description: 'The working directory to use for resolving paths for .ruby-version, .tool-versions and Gemfile.lock.'
  cache-version:
    description: |
      Arbitrary string that will be added to the cache key of the bundler cache. Set or change it if you need
      to invalidate the cache.
